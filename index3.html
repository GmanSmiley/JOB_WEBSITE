					<content>
						<p>I job shadowed at the City Hall of Couer d' Alene, where they have many jobs occuring. I was able to have a look at the plans of McEuen Park and understand the designs for the parking lot and buildings. I had a great time job shadowing, it was fun and a much needed experience for me. I was able to understand and grasp the needing to have an ongoing interactive enviroment, so that I could think more clearly and portray my creaativeness while working.</p>
